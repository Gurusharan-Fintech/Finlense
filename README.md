*FinLens AI â€” The Next Generation's Financial Analyst.*

What if analysing a Billion dollar company felt as exciting as watching your favourite creator on Instagram?
With FinLens AI (AI-powered financial analysis assistant) analyzing public company finances has never been easier. FinLens Ai covers the much-needed combination of valuable analysis, storytelling, and engaging content suitable for the younger audience.

*AI-Infused Company Analysis:* Financial APIs and AI models ascertain the valuation, sentiment, and market position of the company and provide scenario-based clear insights.

*Document Intelligence:* Users can submit and integrate into the analysis earnings reports, PDFs, press releases, and other documents for a richer, more evidence-backed perspective.

*Personalized Analogies*: Shows finance using different niches: cars, sports, gaming, or fashion, and adjusts to their expertise.

*Multi-Format Storytelling:*
->PPT generator for investor-ready slides.
->Professional explainer video for clarity.
->Brainrot-style video for fast-paced Gen Z learning. (extremely effective for today's generation)

The complexities of finance and discussions no younger generation can have on meaningful investments have kept the younger generation rather anxious. FinLens AI tackles this problem through storytelling analysis. Financial literacy has also been made rigorous and fun thanks to this.
